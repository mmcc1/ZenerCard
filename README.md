# ZenerCard - Extrasensory perception (ESP) Testing Software 
 
ZenerCard is a fun little program to test your psychic abilities (or prove they do not exist).  Specifically, the program tests the ability to predict the future. 
 
How it works 
After clicking 'Start', click one of the Zener Cards presented, this will be your selection.  The program will then pick a card at random using RNGCryptoServiceProvider (a cryptographic source of random numbers) and will compare the cards.  The statistics will be updated after each selection. The test does not end, but the stats can be reset.
 
Are you psychic?

After a sustained period, for example every 100 incorrect answers, note your '% correct': 
 
under 35% - Essentially chance 
35-45 - Could be a fluke 
45-60 - Raised eyebrow 
60-100 - You are going to be famous 

The longer the test is performed, the more accurate the test is.  Try runs of a few thousand selections to get the best results.
